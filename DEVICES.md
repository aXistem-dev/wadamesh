# Supported devices

Current hardware support, install paths and maturity. "Stable" means the board
ships on the stable release channel; "Beta" means it is new and lives on the
test channel until the next stable promote. Install links:
[flasher.wadamesh.com](https://flasher.wadamesh.com) (browser, Chrome/Edge over
USB) and the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ALLFATHER-BV/wadamesh/releases).

## Feature notes per board

- **T-Deck**: the everything device: touch, physical keyboard, trackball cursor
  or d-pad navigation, microSD (deep 5000-message chat history, map tile packs,
  data storage), GPS on the Plus, notification sounds through the I2S speaker.
  Because the board has no battery-backed clock, Clock settings can optionally
  use a saved Wi-Fi network once after a true cold boot to obtain the time, then
  return Wi-Fi to off. This is off by default; saved open networks require a
  second explicit opt-in and unknown networks are never joined.
  Tap Sym or Alt for one symbol, or double-tap either to lock the symbol layer;
  this needs [LilyGO keyboard-controller firmware with raw matrix mode](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Deck/tree/master/examples/Keyboard_ESP32C3)
  (June 2025 or newer). Older controller firmware keeps normal typing and
  reports the unavailable latch mode on Serial.
- **T-Deck Pro**: separate `LilyGo_TDeck_Pro_v1_0_companion_radio_touch` and
  `LilyGo_TDeck_Pro_v1_1_companion_radio_touch` targets for the incompatible PCB
  revisions. V1.0 has no frontlight and uses GPIO45 for touch reset; V1.1 uses
  GPIO45 for its frontlight and GPIO38 for touch reset. Flashing the V1.1 image
  onto V1.0 holds touch in reset. Both use the GDEQ031T10 e-paper panel,
  CST328/CST3530 touch detection, and the Pro-specific TCA8418 matrix. See
  [variants/lilygo_tdeck_pro/PORT.md](variants/lilygo_tdeck_pro/PORT.md) before
  choosing a target.
- **T-Deck Max**: `LilyGo_TDeck_Max_companion_radio_touch`. The same e-paper,
  keyboard and radio as the Pro, whose display and touch drivers it reuses; the
  differences are an XL9555 expander in front of the peripheral power enables and
  resets, a BQ27220 fuel gauge, and the three capacitive pads under the glass.
  See variants/lilygo_tdeck_max/PORT.md.
- **Heltec V4 + TFT**: touch UI with the on-screen keyboard; the optional
  Expansion Kit adds environment sensors (home-screen chart) and a piezo
  buzzer. On the original Expansion Kit, tap **IO** for Back or hold it for one
  second to return Home; this reuses GPIO35, so that target no longer drives the
  same line as a TX LED. **PWR** remains the expansion board's hardware power
  control and is not readable by firmware. V4.3 boards get the switchable
  high-gain receive LNA toggle. Both V4 targets auto-detect an optional M5Stack
  CardKB at address `0x5F` on the board I2C bus (GPIO4/3 on V4, GPIO17/18 on
  V4-R8). It provides text and focus navigation; the on-screen keyboard remains
  available when CardKB is absent or when the active field is tapped again.
  V4-R8 also offers font-only Normal, Large and Huge text presets under Display;
  controls retain their normal geometry so the compact screen stays navigable.
- **Tanmatsu**: keyboard-driven UI (no touchscreen) with the coloured function
  keys mapped to tabs, ALT accent picker, UI scaling (Normal/Large/Huge),
  microSD for all persistent data. Ships through the Tanmatsu launcher store,
  updates arrive as store updates.
- **T-Lora Pager**: no touchscreen at all — the QWERTY keyboard and the rotary
  encoder drive everything (Alt+turn free-scrolls a page; see
  [TLORA_PAGER_SHORTCUTS.md](TLORA_PAGER_SHORTCUTS.md) for the full key map).
  Tap Fn/Alt for one symbol or double-tap it to lock the symbol layer; physical
  hold combinations keep their existing behavior.
  GPS, microSD, keyboard backlight, lock screen and notification sound through
  the onboard codec and amp all work. Two builds, one per radio: LR1121 and
  SX1262 — flashing the wrong one leaves you with no radio, so check the label
  on your unit. The onboard PCF85063A keeps time through a full power-off and is
  synchronized automatically whenever the firmware accepts time from NTP, GPS,
  a companion, CLI, or mesh bootstrap. A card the Pager detects but cannot read shows up in File
  Manager greyed, and tapping it retries the mount; formatting is deliberately
  left to a computer (FAT32) rather than done on-device.
- **ThinkNode M9**: keyboard plus d-pad navigation (no touch), same feature set
  as the other boards where the hardware allows. Every key and mode is covered
  in the [keyboard & d-pad guide](THINKNODE_M9_SHORTCUTS.md). Its PCF8563 is
  validated at boot; if it reports lost integrity, the same optional saved-Wi-Fi
  cold-boot sync offered on T-Deck is available in Clock settings. New in beta_38;
  report anything that feels off.
- **T-Display P4**: touch UI with the on-screen keyboard. The BOOT button wakes
  the screen (or lights the lock screen) and holding it for two seconds locks or
  unlocks, as the Wio Tracker L2's wake button does; "Lock when screen off" is
  under Settings, Lock screen. The optional clip-on
  keyboard expansion can be attached or removed while running and is picked up
  within a couple of seconds; while it is on, it types into the focused field
  and the on-screen keyboard stays down (tap the field again to bring it up).
  Arrows move the caret or the focus highlight, Esc goes back, F1-F5 open the
  tabs left to right, F11 steps the keyboard light through off, low, medium and
  high (the level is kept across reboots), Caps Lock lights its LEDs,
  and Shift, Sym and Alt apply to the next key. Alt+Backspace goes back.
- **RAK WisMesh Tap V2**: newest port, touch-driven. The browser-flash path is
  fresh; if the flasher cannot open the serial port, put the board in download
  mode manually and retry, and please report it.
- **Seeed Wio Tracker L2**: pre-release touch target under active bring-up. Builds are for
  development and hardware validation only; no public release artifact is
  promised until the port is verified.
- **CrowPanel Advance 3.5**: `crowpanel_35_companion_radio_touch` is a
  16 MB flash / 8 MB OPI PSRAM build for the ILI9488/GT911 panel and an SX1262
  in the expansion slot. It starts upright in 480x320 landscape; Display
  settings can switch to 320x480 portrait, rotated 180 degrees. The selected
  orientation persists across reboots; landscape is only the default when no
  saved choice exists.
  It uses the same compact font and control sizing as Wio Tracker L2.
  Fit the radio before booting. GPIO0 is shared by BOOT and the radio's chip
  select, so BOOT is not configured as a wake/unlock input on stock wiring.
  Screen-off remains touch-wakeable; hard lock is disabled without a separate
  unlock button. See the
  [official schematic](https://github.com/Elecrow-RD/CrowPanel-Advance-HMI-ESP32-AI-Display/blob/master/3.5/schematic/ESP32%20Display%203.5%20inch%20V1.0.sch)
  and [reference radio pin map](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/blob/master/variants/esp32s3/elecrow_panel/variant.h).
  An optional external GPS can be connected to UART1 (CrowPanel RX GPIO18 /
  TX GPIO17, 9600 baud). Data
  can use a FAT32 microSD card for data, offline maps, File Manager and browser
  Transfer. The card uses software SPI (SCLK 5, MISO 4, MOSI 6, CS 7), leaving
  the display and radio SPI hosts untouched; missing or unreadable cards fall
  back to SPIFFS. The dedicated LittleFS partition remains the internal tile
  cache. Cards are never auto-formatted; format them on a computer. Serial
  uses the board's USB-to-UART bridge. Battery voltage monitoring is not
  supported. Display, touch, radio and SD still need validation on a physical
  CrowPanel. Like Wio Tracker L2, it is included in the all-target builds and local beta release
  scripts, not the two-board stable CI workflow. Select it in the upload
  helper with `scripts/build-upload-monitor.sh --crowpanel-35`.
- **SenseCAP Indicator D1L / D1Pro**: USB-powered, no battery (the UI shows a USB
  glyph and hides Power off). The RP2040 peripherals (buzzer, microSD, Grove, D1Pro
  sensors) are not used yet, and without storage there are no map tiles. See
  [variants/sensecap_indicator/PORT.md](variants/sensecap_indicator/PORT.md).

## Requested boards

Open hardware requests, roughly in demand order. Ports are welcome, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); the M9 and Tap V2 both started as community
PRs.

- LilyGo T-Deck Pro hardware validation / T-Deck Max variants: [#62](https://github.com/ALLFATHER-BV/wadamesh/issues/62)

## Channels

- **Stable**: the tested default. The flasher installs it unless you pick Beta.
- **Beta**: new features and fixes earlier; on-device opt-in via Settings,
  About, "Get test builds (beta)". New boards debut here and move to Stable
  with the next promote.
