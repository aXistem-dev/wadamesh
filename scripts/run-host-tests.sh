# line in a comment and is compiled standalone. That is cheap and fast, but it
# also means nothing ever ran them all together -- so test_touch_prefs_schema
# sat broken for two schema versions (v64 appended two fields and its sums were
# not updated) without anyone noticing. A static_assert that does not compile is
# not a guard, and that particular one exists to catch the mid-struct insert
# that poisoned beta_44 and beta_57. One command, run it before a release.
